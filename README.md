### Data preparation
- If you want to run the code, you need to download the [CHAOS](https://chaos.grand-challenge.org/) datasets for tasks.

- Data should be stored in the correct directory tree.

For CHAOS, it should like this:

  $inputs_chaos

  |-- All_Sets  
  |--|--Case_No      
  |--|--|--T1DUAL         
  |--|--|--|--DICOM_anon            
  |--|--|--|--Ground

### Others
There is also some examples of the trained models and segmentation results in the root, you can visit them directly.
